# Slider-HTML-CSS
Simple slider written on pure CSS (without JS)
Slides transition is performed with the use of animation. In case animation is not supported by some browsers, there is a possibility to switch slides manually by pressing toggles.
Slides transition can be arranged vertical (style_vertical.css), statically (style_static.css), horizontal (style_horizontal.css).
